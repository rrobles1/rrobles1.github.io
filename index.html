Hello, my name is Bobby, and I am a student of the UT Data Vizualization Bootcamp. 
I have lived in Austin, Texas, for about four years now, but I am originally from Brownsville, Texas.

During my time here in Austin I have come to enjoy the sport of rock climbing. There are lots of cool
places to go climbng both indoors and outdoors.
